# Books

More than any other field, management is full of fluffy books that could be summarized in one 100-word article. That being said, there's a number of excellent books, listed below.

## Turn the Ship Around!: A True Story of Turning Followers into Leaders

[Turn the Ship Around!: A True Story of Turning Followers into Leaders](http://www.amazon.com/Turn-Ship-Around-Turning-Followers/dp/1591846404) 📖 is hands down my preferred management book.

This book made me truly understand what empowering local decision means. In particular, I liked how the author explains that the usual chain of command requires information to go up the chain, and decision to go down, which is insanely inefficient.

It provides great tools for managers to help their team members come up with their own decisions, in particular the notion of **deliberate action**. There's a also [a presentation](http://www.slideshare.net/micrimson/turn-the-ship-around-041614) that talks about the main concepts the author developed.

There are numerous cheesy management books and this is not one of them. The narration is great as well and the explanations are short, and to the point.

You can find a short summary in video [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psAXMqxwol8) 🎞.

# Engineering Management Resources

This is a list of inspiring articles related to engineering management. Those are usually short and concise articles that are packed with inspiring and concrete ideas. They have shaped my own management practice, and I hope they will inspire you as well.

I don't necessarily agree with everything listed here. Actually, you'll see that some of those articles have diametrically opposed opinions. I do believe those thought-provoking resources will help you in your manager journey.

## Strategy

Shameless plug here, two presentations I contributed to:

* [Amazon: the hidden empire](http://www.slideshare.net/faberNovel/amazoncom-the-hidden-empire)
* [Apple: 8 easy steps to beat Microsoft](http://www.slideshare.net/faberNovel/apple-study-8-easy-steps-to-beat-microsoft-and-google)
* [Michael Porter's generic strategies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Porter%27s_generic_strategies) (Wikipedia)
* [Steve Jobs explaining why you should start from the customers, and go backward](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FF-tKLISfPE) (video 🎞). He makes the point that stopping the OpenDoc project was the right thing to do because it was a technology without any customer.
* [Can Do Vs Must Do](http://avc.com/2017/05/can-do-vs-must-do/) , AVC. "Doing a startup is like playing a video game. Each level requires you to master one thing and once you do that, you level up and then there is a new thing to master."
* "Waterline principle" from Bill Gore: "Think of being on a ship, and imagine that any decision gone bad will blow a hole in the side of the ship. If you blow a hole above the waterline (where the ship won’t take on water and possibly sink), you can patch the hole, learn from the experience, and sail on. But if you blow a hole below the waterline, you can find yourself facing gushers of water pouring in, pulling you toward the ocean floor. And if it’s a big enough hole, you might go down really fast, just like some of the financial firm catastrophes of 2008. To be clear, great enterprises do make big bets, but they avoid big bets that could blow holes below the waterline.", How We Might Fall.

## Training

* [Great developers are raised, not hired](https://sizovs.net/2019/04/10/the-best-developers-are-raised-not-hired/)
	* Take some money, energy, time that you spend on recruiting and invest it in teaching your best developers mentoring skills.
	* Adjust your interview process and give a chance to candidates that are not good enough yet, but are eager to learn and have a growth mindset.
	* Relax “hard requirements” in your job ads to avoid filtering out impostors.

## Work ethics & work/life balance

* [The Virtues of Laziness and Impatience](http://www.elidedbranches.com/2016/06/the-virtues-of-laziness-and-impatience.html): "there are two areas I encourage you to practice showing, right now: figuring out what’s important, and going home."

## TV Shows

Netflix's [Chef's table](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chef%27s_Table) profiles a couple world-renown chef. The kitchen world bears a lot of similarities with management. In the season two, I especially recommend episode 1 and 3:

* [Alex Atala](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alex_Atala)'s story shows that you need to constantly reinvent and disrupt yourself.
* [Dominique Crenn](http://www.ateliercrenn.com/) explains how she was given ownership over her work in her first kitchen experience (where she was basically given just a dish name, a list of ingredients, and was expected to invent the recipe with no kitchen training). She replicated that in her own kitchen.

# Keeping up-to-date: blogs and newsletters

Here are some blogs and newsletter I follow.

## Newsletter

* [Software Lead Weekly](http://softwareleadweekly.com/) (Oren Ellenbogen): a short curation of great management articles. Also include some videos, and some less serious, funny material. A lot of the links founds in this repo appeared in Oren's weekly email.
* [HBR's Management Tip of the Day](https://hbr.org/email-newsletters)
* [Tech People Leadership](http://newsletter.techpeopleleadership.com/) (Joe Dunn): Links, notes and opinions for leaders in the tech industry.

## Blogs

* [Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com/): mandatory if you want to stay abreast of what's going in tech. There are some good management articles from time to time as well. Since it can be a pretty huge time sink, I subscribe to a curation of the top articles instead ([RSS feed here](http://www.daemonology.net/hn-daily/index.rss)).
